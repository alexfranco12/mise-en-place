## Major Hurdles
This project was challenging and I learned a lot from my struggles. My first hurdle was learning how to use Postman to my benifit and how the Spoonacular API functions. My biggest hurdle was trying to pass information from one component to another component and then once its passed, being able to iterate through the elements to be able to display the information I wanted to the page. Another hurdle I continue to have is CSS and styling. 

## Stretch Goals
- [x] filter by cuisine
- [ ] see a given recipes sweetness/savoriness/bitterness/... levels
- [ ] display similar recipes
- [ ] list equipment needed
- [ ] food trivia/jokes
